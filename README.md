# pixelEditor

This a clone and extension of the pixelEditor app created in this article: <https://jakelazaroff.com/words/an-interactive-intro-to-crdts/>. S/o to Jake!

This repo contains multiple versions of the app with varying levels of functionality.

V1:
This is near one-to-one copy of the original code found in the blog post. The differences are:

- Added a test suite for the various functions using Jest
- Changed the bundler from Parcel to Webpack
- Commented out individual functions and classes
